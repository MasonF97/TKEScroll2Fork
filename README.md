# TKE Scroll Website
This is a brand new website for the scroll of Tau Kappa Epsilon Xi-Upsilon.
The original website was done in Django when I was in my first or second year of Software Engineering, so it is a massive pile of spaghetti. This is a complete rewrite of the entire website from scratch. This was done partly for educational purposes, but I also wanted to make the website more accessible and easier to maintain for the chapter. 
## Features
* Brand new, mobile-first design
* Can be saved and used as a mobile app. It can even work offline!
